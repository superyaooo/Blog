### > This Blog
This blog is built via Github Pages. It has a custom stylesheet and Javascript. I chose Github Pages for my technical blog because:
* It's free.
* It's fun and different from how my previous projects were built.

### > The Author
My name is Yao Wang. Many people think I'm a front-end developer based on the fact that I have a personal website and web projects. However, I've been doing mostly back-end stuff with my real life job. Since I love both front-end and back-end development, I consider myself a full-stack developer.
