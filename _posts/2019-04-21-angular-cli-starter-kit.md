As the title suggests, this post will be short and sweet to get your local angular project built and running.<!--more-->

First `cd` into your repo.  
Then `npm install @angular/cli` or `npm install @angular/cli@latest` to get the latest version. This will install it locally. If you want it globally, simply add `-g` after `install`.  
After that, `npm i` to install the dependencies.  
Finally, `ng serve --open` to run and auto open a webpage for your project locally.

And, we're done!
